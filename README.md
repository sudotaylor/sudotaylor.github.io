# Welcome! #
## This is the README for the sudotaylor GitHub webpage. ##

### This webpage is *under construction* (and at a very early stage). ###

- Please report any errors in the "Issues" tab in this repository.
   - Advice / requests for future updates are welcome as well!
- Apologies in advance for the time this will take to get fully operational.
  - I will work as quickly as possible to add critical functionality.
  - I publish a list of planned updates and their relative priorities as this comes together.


Thank you for your patience,
Taylor
